# fizz-buzz-java

I decided to start learning java and this is my first attempt at programming something in said language.
This is a classic fizz-buzz game that prints out fizz if a number is divisible by 3, buzz if the number is divisible by 5 and fizzbuzz if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5. Otherwise the output will just be a number.
